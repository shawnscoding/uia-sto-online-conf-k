# Achievement

### This project has brought over 10 additional contracts.

#### Some of the biggest projects I've built are listed below.

### Created reusable components and APIs.

During the development, we created several reusable components and APIs. This allowed us to save time and make greater profits.

#### Reusable radio input component on [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/radio-3mtce?file=/src/App.jsx).

### This project motivated me to build a reactjs open-source library

#### [Link To My Crontab library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactjs-crontab)
[![demo photo](assets/crontab.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactjs-crontab)

I realised building a crontab (scheduling jobs) is quite tedious and difficult to test. This motivated me to create a node open-source package, which allows you to easily build a crontab functionality. I created this package entirely on my own. There is an average of approximately 300 weekly downloads.

# Note

Due to the company policy, I am unable to open the source code.
