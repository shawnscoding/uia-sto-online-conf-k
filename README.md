# Role & Responsibility

My responsibility was developing both front-end and back-end. Collaborating with management, departments, and customers to identify end-user requirements and specifications. Testing and deploying applications. Troubleshooting, debugging, maintaining and improving existing software.

저의 업무는 프런트 엔드와 백 엔드 모두를 개발하는 것이었습니다. 기획자, 디자이너 그리고 개발자들과 협업하며 프로젝트를 성공적으로 이끌어 가려 노력함에 더불어 고객과 최종 사용자의 요구사항을 명확히 파악해 필요한 기능만을 구현함으로 불 필요한 시간을 단축했습니다. 그 밖에도 애플리케이션 테스트 및 배포, 기존 소프트웨어의 문제 해결, 유지 관리 및 개선에 크게 기여했습니다.


### My responsibilities in this project include:

- Front-end 시스템 디자인 
- Expressjs RESTful API 구현
- Mysql Query 구현  
- User Authentication
- React Component 생성 (tables, banners, poppers, Modals, buttons 등)
- 푸쉬 알람, VOD 그리고 라이브 스트리밍 스케줄링
- 브라우저 호환 (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, MS Edge, IE11)
- Gitlab branch, PR 관리 
- 한국어 영어 번역
- 외국인 유저 기술 지원 & 상담
- 파일 업로드, 다운로드 기능 구현 
- 반응형 디자인 (모바일 기기, 테블릿 지원)
- 데이터 통계

### Created reusable components and APIs.

During the development, we created several reusable components and APIs. This allowed us to save time and make greater profits.

#### Reusable radio input component on [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/radio-3mtce?file=/src/App.jsx).

### This project motivated me to build a reactjs open-source library

#### [Link To My Crontab library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactjs-crontab)
[![demo photo](assets/crontab.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactjs-crontab)

I realised building a crontab (scheduling jobs) is quite tedious and difficult to test. This motivated me to create a node open-source package, which allows you to easily build a crontab functionality. I created this package entirely on my own. There is an average of approximately 300 weekly downloads.

# Note

Due to the company policy, I am unable to open the source code.
